# GradleFundamental
This is all about basics of Gradle configs and tasks

 Create a Gradle Project - I used Intellij

 New Project - Choose Gradle - Additional Libraries I selected JAVA - Name and Finish

 Alternatively you can chose - gradle init. Output is below for both the steps

  ── build.gradle  
  ── gradle
    ── wrapper
       ── gradle-wrapper.jar  
       ── gradle-wrapper.properties  
  ── gradlew  
  ── gradlew.bat  
  ── settings.gradle  

Gradle build script for configuring the current project
Gradle Wrapper executable JAR
Gradle Wrapper configuration properties
Gradle Wrapper script for Unix-based systems
Gradle Wrapper script for Windows
Gradle settings script for configuring the Gradle build


 Here we have tried few basic operations in gradle like, Creating a task and executing it, scan function to publish results
